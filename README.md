# Cancer Classification in Python

This is a machine learning project where Neural Networks are used to classify cancerous tumors based on gene expression data.

The main purpose of this project is to train a model to predict types of tumors, but it also highlights the importance of preprocessing data before training a neural network.


Running all of the code in the notebook will take some time, so the output of each cell ran in order is included.
